In these modules, my contributions have included :

- Users can perform better Verification and Validation tasks, as the new system improves data consistency and includes validation checks, ensuring accurate data input and enabling edit functions.
- Create a Global Function that retrieves and displays all relevant information based on a License. This function can be reused by other developers as needed
- Implement a search function across all modules of the system.
